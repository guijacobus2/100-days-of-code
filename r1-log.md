# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Guilherme Jacobus

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 28, Friday, 2022.

## Log

### Day 1: January 28, Friday

Today's Progress: Applied for a job at Abletech, which required a solution to a programming problem using any language. I chose Javascript.

Thoughts: Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: January 29, Saturday

Today's Progress: Developed a simple copy of Snake Game using Flutter for Android and iOS.

Thoughts: Easy project to test some basic skills such as handling touch screen commands and updating the UI in real-time. Design is not so great, but good enough to play the game.

### Days 3 & 4:January 30, Sunday & 31, Monday

Today's Progress: Came back to a project from 2021, reviewed the whole code, and fixed new bugs and compatibility / version issues. It’s a great project idea, specially for this 100 days challenge, will have heaps of stuff to work on.

Link to work: I can’t share the link to the project as it’s a personal project, but once it’s almost done I can share the link. I’ll share screenshots of the app (results) each day.
