The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 28, Friday, 2022.

## Log

### Day 1: January 28, Friday

Today's Progress: Applied for a job at Abletech, which required a solution to a programming problem using any language. I chose Javascript.

Thoughts: Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: January 29, Saturday

Today's Progress: Developed a simple copy of Snake Game using Flutter for Android and iOS.

Thoughts: Easy project to test some basic skills such as handling touch screen commands and updating the UI in real-time. Design is not so great, but good enough to play the game.

### Days 3 & 4:January 30, Sunday & 31, Monday

Today's Progress: Came back to a project from 2021, reviewed the whole code, and fixed new bugs and compatibility / version issues.

Thoughts: It’s a great project idea, specially for this 100 days challenge, will have heaps of stuff to work on.

Link to work: I can’t share the link to the project as it’s a personal project, but once it’s almost done I can share the link. I’ll share screenshots of the app (results) each day.

### Day 5: February 1, Tuesday

Today's Progress: Developed the Register Screen, the Login Screen, and the Reset password Screen for the project. Decided to use Firebase as the database for the project.

Thoughts: Firebase is a great noSQL database to work along with Flutter apps. Easy setup for the app and easy to set up the Register and Sign In functions.

### Day 6 & 7: February 2, Wednesday & 3, Thursday

Today's Progress: Built the profile setup screen. With the use of Firebase and Google Maps API, I developed a function to get the address and convert it to geohash coordinates. Also, made a function to upload and store user profile image on Firebase.

Thoughts: It was a bit difficult to understand how to convert an address to geohash so I could query through all the users by location, but a good exercise. Also, storing user data with Firebase is super easy.

### Day 8 & 9: February 4, Friday & 5, Saturday

Today's Progress: haven’t done much this 2 days. Currently having a bug with the iOS version of the app. Android version works without bugs, but iOS is crashing, something related to dependencies compatibility and A new Firebase version for iOS.

Thoughts: Started with a bug on both Android and iOS, but the Android version was easier to fix, just updated some dependencies, but for iOS there’s a new Firebase package which is causing problems for the app, still trying to fix it.


### Day 10: February 8, Tuesday

Today's Progress: Built a simple Multi-Select Widget using the package "Multi Select Flutter", which has a few features like FormField validator.

Thoughts: Flutter has awesome packages which are easy to use, and it amazes me what people can do with such power.

### Day 11: February 17, Thursday

Today's progress: Haven't posted lately, but I started this new native iOS boootcamp with SwiftUI, and developed this begginer dice roller app.

Thoughts: Working with native iOS is completely different from Flutter, but for me I am having a great experience with it, and XCode is pretty intuitive.
