### Day 2: January 29, Saturday

Today's Progress: Developed a simple copy of Snake Game using Flutter for Android and iOS.

Thoughts: Easy project to test some basic skills such as handling touch screen commands and updating the UI in real-time. Design is not so great, but good enough to play the game.
